# Survival-Revamped (Name subject to change)
Minecraft plugin that makes survival more challenging and rich.

The goal of Survival Revamped is to make players afraid again and navigate the game in ways they otherwise wouldn't in a vanilla playthrough.

## Support
The goal is 1.12.x, 1.16.x, and rolling off the latest MC version but this is based on the support received.

Right now, Im currently working on 1.16 and will migrate when the plugin reaches a good point.

## Design Philosophy

- Punish/Reward the player for taking risks.
- Bring back fear and danger without absolute brutality.
- If I'm bored or not concernced for my safety then something isn't right.
- Present an obstacle that can be circumvented through alternative gameplay.
